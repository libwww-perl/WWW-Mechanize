=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use LWP::Simple qw(get);
  my $server = Test::HTTP::LocalServer->spawn;

  ok get $server->url, "Retrieve " . $server->url;

  $server->stop;

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<Test::HTTP::LocalServer-E<gt>spawn %ARGS>

This spawns a new HTTP server. The server will stay running until
C<< $server->stop >> is called.

Valid arguments are:

=over 4

=item *

C<< html => >> scalar containing the page to be served

=item *

C<< file => >> filename containing the page to be served

=item *

C<<  debug => 1 >> to make the spawned server output debug information

=item *

C<<  eval => >> string that will get evaluated per request in the server

Try to avoid characters that are special to the shell, especially quotes.
A good idea for a slow server would be

  eval => sleep+10

=back

All served HTML will have the first %s replaced by the current location.

The following entries will be removed from C<%ENV>:

    HTTP_PROXY
    http_proxy
    CGI_HTTP_PROXY
    HTTPS_PROXY
    https_proxy
    HTTP_PROXY_ALL
    http_proxy_all

  $self->{_pid} = $pid;

  $self;
};

=head2 C<< $server->port >>

This returns the port of the current server. As new instances
will most likely run under a different port, this is convenient
if you need to compare results from two runs.

=cut

sub port {
  carp __PACKAGE__ . '::port called without a server' unless $_[0]->{_server_url};
  $_[0]->{_server_url}->port
};

=head2 C<< $server->url >>

This returns the url where you can contact the server. This url
is valid until the C<$server> goes out of scope or you call
C<< $server->stop >> or C<< $server->get_log >>.

=cut

sub url {
  $_[0]->{_server_url}->abs->as_string
};

=head2 C<< $server->stop >>

This stops the server process by requesting a special
url.

=cut

sub stop {
    my ($self) = @_;
    get( $self->quit_server );
    undef $self->{_server_url};
    if ( $self->{_fh} ) {
        close $self->{_fh};
        delete $self->{_fh};
    }
};

=head2 C<< $server->kill >>

This kills the server process via C<kill>. The log
cannot be retrieved then.

=cut

sub kill {
  CORE::kill( 9 => $_[0]->{ _pid } );
  undef $_[0]->{_server_url};
  undef $_[0]->{_pid};
};

=head2 C<< $server->get_log >>

This stops the server by calling C<stop> and then returns the
output of the server process. This output will be a list of
all requests made to the server concatenated together
as a string.

=cut

sub get_log {
  my ($self) = @_;
  
  my $log = get( $self->get_server_log );
  $self->stop;
  return $log;
};

sub DESTROY {
  $_[0]->stop if $_[0]->{_server_url};
  for my $file (@{$_[0]->{delete}}) {
    unlink $file or warn "Couldn't remove tempfile $file : $!\n";
  };
};

=head1 URLs implemented by the server

=head2 302 redirect C<< $server->redirect($target) >>

This URL will issue a redirect to C<$target>. No special care is taken
towards URL-decoding C<$target> as not to complicate the server code.
You need to be wary about issuing requests with escaped URL parameters.

=head2 404 error C<< $server->error_notfound($target) >>

This URL will response with status code 404.

=head2 Timeout C<< $server->error_timeout($seconds) >>

This URL will send a 599 error after C<$seconds> seconds.

=head2 Timeout+close C<< $server->error_close($seconds) >>

This URL will send nothing and close the connection after C<$seconds> seconds.

=head2 Error in response content C<< $server->error_after_headers >>

This URL will send headers for a successfull response but will close the
socket with an error after 2 blocks of 16 spaces have been sent.

=head2 Chunked response C<< $server->chunked >>

This URL will return 5 blocks of 16 spaces at a rate of one block per second
in a chunked response.

=head2 Other URLs

All other URLs will echo back the cookies and query parameters.
